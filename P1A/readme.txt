This project is a PHP web server warm-up, so it is not difficult to finish it.
The function eval() in PHP is powerful to process mathematical expression and calculate it, although we can implement it through Reverse Polish Notation.
Thus we only need to use Regular Expression to match the input string and gracefully handle some special cases.
My logic is described in the source file by necessary notations.

Thanks~
